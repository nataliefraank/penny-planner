# penny-planner
Single mother financial simulator.

## Summary
The Single Mother Financial Simulator, "Penny-Planner", simulates a single mother living in Chicago in 2022.

## Runnable
Run financial_simulator.py.

## Usage
The user should input different numbers to lead through different game tracks. The user may make choices that impact their parenting wellness, their employment status, their health, their child's health, and their money.

## User input
The user inputs 1 / 2 / 3 frequently to determine their actions and their funds-spending.

## Game output
Inputs lead to various storylines that typically take place every day. There are a few storylines that lead through the entire game. At the end of the game, the program ranks how good of a mother and employee you were. It keeps track of your funds and counts if you can pay rent or not.

## Documentation of game creation
#### Goal
I will create an online game that simulates financial spending as a lower-income American. Users will begin with a set amount of money and progress through the game while trying to afford a product or commodity as the end result. They will make various choices and gain various items to "win" or "lose" the game.

#### Planning
Inputs: What will you request from the user? I will request these potential inputs from the user: a. What career they would like b. How many children they have c. Where they live d. How much money they would like to spend on various items (groceries, car, insurance, etc) e. What they would like to buy?

Computation: How are you transforming the inputs into something else? What data types could be helpful for managing information in the program? What functions will you create/use to produce specific effects? I will create dictionaries that process different types of inputs and their resulting outputs. I will also use various functions to track funding loss and funding gain. I will use for/while loops to run mini quizzes. I will likely load images or mini games using functions and recursion patterns.

Outputs: What will you present to the user? I will present various questions, funding checkpoints, and results to the user. This includes the success of their completion in gaining the object. I might also offer information on poverty in America.

#### Reflection
I learned how to organize an in-depth multi-branched game that would yield different results. I learned how to use dictonaries across functions and files. I learned how to try-except interger inputs. I wish that I added more cross-functional tracks that were relevant to the game. I also wished that I could have added a visual component to the game to assist the user with functionability.
